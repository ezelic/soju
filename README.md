# Soju
Soju is a simplified version of what those consider to be an essential to making Minecraft mods.

**NOTE: This library is not production ready! There will be many bugs.**

Notes: 
* This library is only for 1.19 ONLY. Anything lower is bound to break in some areas because Mojang tinkers with code.
* This library was primarily made in Kotlin. You must be on Kotlin 1.7.10 or Soju will most likely break.

If anyone is willing to make a 1.8.9 branch, feel free to do so. However, I see practically no point as UniversalCraft exists, 
which accomplishes all of the primary goals that this library would've done.
